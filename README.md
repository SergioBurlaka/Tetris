Tetris Game

This is my first game in javaScript. http://snpro.pl/09617993326/SergeyBurlaka/Tetris/src/index.html I started it becouse of to improve my skils in programing and implimenting designe paterns and realize OOP principles. 
The game engine was created by me. The graphic design of the game I made is similar to the game on this site http://www.tetris24.com/ . When creating the game, I used the library jQuery, gained experience working with graphic library RaphaÃ«l js that simplify workin with SVG.
