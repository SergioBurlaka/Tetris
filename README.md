Tetris Game

This is my first game in javaScript.
 You can play by clicking the link: http://snpro.pl/09617993326/SergeyBurlaka/Tetris/src/index.html 
I started it becouse of to improve my skils in programing and implimenting designe paterns and realize OOP principles. 
The game engine was created by me. The graphic design of the game I made is similar to the game on this site http://www.tetris24.com/ . When creating the game, I used the library jQuery, gained experience working with graphic library RaphaÃ«l js that simplify workin with SVG.

Hot keys: 
space - rotate figure;
left arrow - move left;
right arrow - move right;
down arrow - accelerated move down;
